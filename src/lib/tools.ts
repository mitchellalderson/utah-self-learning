/**
 * Tools — pi-coding-agent's battle-tested coding tools, wrapped for Inngest steps.
 *
 * Uses pi-coding-agent's tool implementations directly:
 * - read: offset/limit, image support, binary detection, smart truncation
 * - edit: exact text match + replace (surgical edits, not full file rewrites)
 * - write: create/overwrite files with directory creation
 * - bash: shell execution with configurable timeout and output truncation
 * - grep: regex search respecting .gitignore
 * - find: glob-based file discovery respecting .gitignore
 * - ls: directory listing with tree display
 *
 * Plus custom tools specific to Utah (remember, web_fetch).
